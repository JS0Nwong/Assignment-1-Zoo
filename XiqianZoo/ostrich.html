        Ostriches are large flightless birds of the genus Struthio in the order Struthioniformes, part of the infra-class
        Palaeognathae, a diverse group of flightless birds also known as ratites that includes the emus, rheas, and kiwis. There
        are two living species of ostrich: the common ostrich and the Somali ostrich. They are native to Africa and lay the
        largest eggs of any living land animal. With the ability to run at 70 km/h (43.5 mph), they are the fastest birds on
        land. They are farmed worldwide, particularly for their feathers as they are used as decoration and feather dusters.
        Their skin is also used for leather products. Ostriches are notable for being the heaviest living birds.
