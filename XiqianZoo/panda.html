        The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) also known as the panda bear (or simply
        the panda), is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body.
        The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it
        belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of
        its diet.
