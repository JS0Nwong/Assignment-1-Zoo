        The axolotl is a kind of amphibian, specifically a salamander, that does
        not metamorphose naturally. Usually, amphibians have gills and live
        underwater when they are young, but then they lose their gills, develop
        lungs, and live on land as adults.
        <br />
        <br />
        Axolotls, however, keep their gills and continue living in the water as
        adults. Their gills are their most recognizable trait because they look
        like wispy feathers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Axolotls also develop lungs. Although their main method of breathing is
        through their gills, they occasionally use their lungs to breathe in air
        from the waterâ€™s surface. Because they live in water their whole lives,
        they always have a tail and webbed feet for swimming.
        <br />
        <br />
        Axolotls average 23 cm (9 in.) in length. They vary in color from
        pinkish to brownish green, and often appear to be smiling because of the
        shape of their mouth.
