        Dolphins are incredible. They are socially skilled, intelligent, agile,
        joyful, and playful creatures that share many emotional similarities
        with humans. There is an impressive range of different species of
        dolphin and they all have their own unique identities and
        characteristics!
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently there are 49 dolphin and porpoise species which are grouped
        into six families: the oceanic dolphin family is by far the largest with
        38 members; the porpoise family has seven members; and there are four
        river dolphin families, each containing just one species.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dolphins live in the world’s seas and oceans and in some rivers too.
        Some dolphin species prefer to live in coastal areas, others like
        shallow water but prefer to live away from the coast close to patches of
        shallower water which are located further out to sea.
        <br />
        <br />
        River dolphins such as the Amazon River dolphin (boto) and South Asian
        river dolphins live their lives only in fresh water rivers and lakes, a
        long way from the ocean; they are sometimes known as the ‘true river
        dolphins’. There is another group of so-called river dolphins; these are
        fresh water populations of marine dolphin species some of whom
        permanently live in fresh water rivers, these include the tucuxi (or
        sotalia), the Guiana dolphin, Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless
        porpoise.
