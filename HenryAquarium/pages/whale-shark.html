        The whale shark or Rhincodon typus is the world's largest recorded
        living fish in the ocean. These unique fishes are filter feeders, which
        draw the term 'whale' in their name from the similar feeding technique
        of whales. They are found widely across the globe near the equatorial
        zones. The tropical and temperate waters are the favorite spot of these
        fishes. The slightly warm waters are where these pelagic fishes thrive
        well. These fishes are migratory in nature and are known to travel for
        thousands of kilometers.

        They are carnivorous animals, yet they have their differences from
        sharks. Unlike sharks, whale sharks do not hunt large prey. They are
        most interested in tiny krill, sardines, and planktons. These gentle and
        docile fishes are under threat owing to the high value of their fins and
        flesh. The baby whale sharks are believed to be extremely playful, and
        the adult whale sharks peacefully interact with ocean divers.

        Whale sharks are the largest fish species in the world to date. They are
        a gigantic yet harmless species of sharks, which are very peaceful. This
        fish has a flat head in front of its large head, instead of underneath
        like the other shark species. They are non-aggressive, and many a time,
        it is seen that they allow ocean divers to approach them. It is a
        curious fish and is often found to coexist with other ocean species.
